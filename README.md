A relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL to store user and booking information.
APIs for Flights, Hotels, and Car Rentals:

Integrate APIs to get flight, hotel, and car rental data. Examples include Amadeus, Travelpayouts, or Skyscanner APIs. These offer various services that might support your use case.
Frontend:

Build the frontend with React or Next.js for a dynamic and user-friendly experience.
For design, use a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap to speed up the styling process.
Payments Integration:

Look into regionally supported payment solutions and integrate them through your backend.
Testing and Deployment:

Thoroughly test all features, especially booking flows and payments.
Deploy the site on a cloud platform like Heroku (for beginners) or AWS if more flexibility and control are needed.
Additional Services:

Consider adding push notifications or email updates for users to get booking confirmations and reminders.
